## Code Structure

My Flutter application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, which is a widely used architecture in Flutter when using state management libraries like provider.

Model:
This layer includes data classes and services that interact with external APIs or local storage (e.g., user model, resource model, API calls). It represents the business domain and application data.

View:
The UI components (Flutter widgets) are considered the View. Pages like the login screen, home page, user profile, and search screen are part of this layer. These widgets are responsible only for displaying data and capturing user input.

ViewModel (or Controller):
This layer lies between the Model and View. It contains the presentation logic and interacts with the model to fetch/update data. In this app, ViewModels are implemented using the ChangeNotifier class from the provider package to manage and notify UI of state changes.

Additional Notes:
State Management: The app uses the provider package, which aligns well with MVVM. Each ViewModel extends ChangeNotifier to expose data and methods for the UI to bind to.

Separation of Concerns: Each component is clearly separated, which makes the codebase scalable and testable.

Modularity: Code is organized into logical directories such as models/, views/, view_models/, and services/.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, follow the instructions below to set up both the frontend and backend.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ParityPoint.git
cd ParityPoint
```

### Install Backend Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file for environment variables, such as MongoDB URI and JWT secret. Example:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/paritypoint
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the Fastify server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend API will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Install Frontend Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Update the `base_api_url` in the Flutter app to match your backend URL (typically in a configuration file or constant):

   ```dart
   String baseApiUrl = "http://localhost:3000";  // Update this URL as needed
   ```

4. Run the Flutter app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   The app should now be running on your mobile device or emulator.

## Backend Setup

1. **Install Fastify and MongoDB**:

   The backend uses Fastify to handle API requests and MongoDB for data storage. You can set up MongoDB on your local machine or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

2. **Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_uri` with your actual MongoDB URI and `your_jwt_secret` with a secret key for JWT authentication.

3. **Start the Backend Server**:

   Run the following command to start the Fastify server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Install Flutter and Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Flutter installed. You can follow the installation guide on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Set API URL**:

   Update the `baseApiUrl` variable in the app code to point to your backend API URL.

3. **Run the Flutter App**:

   Run the following command to start the Flutter app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   The app will be available on your mobile device or simulator.
